It's that time of the year again! The latest version of JAWS has been released. And not surprisingly, AI has made an appearance with a new feature called FSCompanion.

FSCompanion is primarily a JAWS learning tool for JAWS and Microsoft applications by providing specific keystrokes as answers. It can answer questions about:

- JAWS usage
- Windows usage and navigation
- Web browsing
- Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint

There are two ways to launch it:

1. From within JAWS, press INSERT + SPACE, then F1.
2. From the [FSCompanion website](https://fscompanion.ai/).

There are also quite a few improvements and fixes to web browsing which is encouraging. I won't go into the details here, but you can find them in the [release notes](https://support.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws/JAWSWhatsNew).

Here are a few web browsing highlights:

- If a table on a web page supports changing the sort order of a column, JAWS now properly recognizes the new sort order and speaks and displays it in Braille.
- Improved JAWS reading in tables where header rows contain elements.
- When INSERT+TAB is pressed on a radio button, JAWS now reads the current radio button along with the group.
- When navigating through radio buttons on a web page, JAWS now correctly announces the position of the selected radio button in the group.
