This year marks my 30th year as an accessibility and assistive technology professional!

My journey began in 1994, right out of college, working for a small assistive tech distributor in Toronto. I started as a technician, building and integrating PCs with assistive technologies, and as the company grew, so did my role. Over the years, I took on everything from training and workplace accommodation consulting to JAWS and Dragon scripting, device repair, and software and website auditing. If it was related to assistive technology and accessibility, I've probably had a hand in it!

In the past decade, my focus has shifted to corporate-level web accessibility, where I now spend my time testing, training, and coaching development teams on creating inclusive digital experiences.

It's been an incredibly fulfilling journey so far, filled with challenges, learning and growth. And along the way, I've met some truly extraordinary people and I'm grateful for all the experiences and people that have shaped this path.
